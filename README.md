## Tech returners
Most recently I have been working on the tech returners full stack developer program, including lots of web development, react, a bit of database work and a group project.
The results of this project can be found in my repos from ~16/8/23 - ~1/10/23, or in my "tech returners" repo.

## Current project
I am currently continuing work on my ebook server project, which was put on hiatus during the tech returners program (see weather app group project)
The aims of the project at this stage are to:
  - Implement a management system for the library using a flask API.
  - Replace the old php code with python (converting to a newer LAMP stack).
  - Modify the layout and CSS to work on a wide range of screen sizes.
  - Bring the older, less polished code up to standard.

See the project repo at: **https://github.com/Camh-git/Simple_Ebook_Server** for more information.
