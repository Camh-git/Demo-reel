  <h3>Vega rocket launches LISA pathfinder</h3>
  At 16:04 GMT on the 3rd of December 2015 the LISA pathfinder probe was launched on top of an ESA Vega rocket from Guiana space centre near kourou in French Guiana.
  <br>
  The probe will head into orbit between the sun and the earth where it will begin its primary mission, which is to try and detect gravitational waves and
  serve as a technology demonstrator for several instruments that will be important for future science missions currently being planned by the ESA, including
  the follow up eLISA(Evolved Laser Interferometer space antenna) observatory.

<h3>Spacex  Lands the Falcon 9 rocket </h3>
Space x managed to safely return and land the first stage of there falcon 9 rocket on landing zone 1 at cape Canaveral aproximately 10 minutes after its
launch from slc 40 at  the same space centre.<br>
The main purpose of the mission was to deliver 11 small communication satellites to low earth orbit for ORBCOMM, these satellites where carried on an 
adaptor connected to the 2nd stage of the rocket which carried them into orbit whilst the first stage prepared itself for landing, with both orbit and
landing planned to be completed around the same time (10 minutes after launch) with the satellites themselves being deployed 5 to 10 minutes later.<br>
The mission was a complete success having properly deployed all 11 satellites that constituted its primary goal and landing the first stage right near the
middle of the landing zone.<br>
Following the success of the mission the satellites will set to work and the first stage will be tested, including re-firing the engines, however this 
particular stage is not planned to fly again.

<h3>Cygnus CRS-4</h3>
After 3 days of delays due to poor weather the Cygnus spacecraft launched on top of an Atlas V rocket on the 6th of December at 21:44: GMT and was captured
by the International Space Station's robotic arm on the 9th at 11:19 and docked to the station's unity module slightly over 3 hours later.
<br><br>
This mission is the first for the Cygnus since October 2014 when the Antares rocket used on the previous mission exploded seconds after launch.
After the failure the rockets creators, orbital sciences, decided to postpone further lights while the antares was redesigned, however since they still had 
to launch a new supply mission the company (now named orbital ATK after a merger) decided to buy a rocket from another company.
The newly upgraded Cygnus(named Deke Slayton 2 after a US astronaut) was launched on top of an Atlas V from the United Launch Alliance (a joint venture 
between Lockheed Martin and Boeing's space divisions), At 7,492kg Cygnus was also the heaviest payload yet put into orbit by an Atlas V.
<br><br>
The spacecraft contains 3,349kg of cargo including 1,181kg of supplies for the crew, just over 1 ton of hardware for the station, 847kg of scientific 
equipment, 87kg of computing resources including some Microsoft hololens devices and 227kg of space walk equipment, this includes a spare SAFER jet pack
to help astronauts should they drift away from the station and space suit parts.
