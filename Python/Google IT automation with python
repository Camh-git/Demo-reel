Recently I took part in and completed the online course:
  Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate
  https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation

This course involved writing some scripts that are more complex and useful than those shown here, but I chose not to upload them since coursera(the website running the course) is not in favour of uploading answers to their tasks.
I would be happy to show these scripts as examples of my work or proof, so long as the person requesting them does not intend to use them to violate coursera's rules.
