This document lays out the basics of a possible management system for the EC site

FORM:
the system will be web based and able to interact with and edit certain elements of the EC website

Functionality:
The primary purpose of the system will be to allow control over cerain webpage elements.
the following elements will be editable by the system:
Homepage: the text within a notice and if it is visible or not. (system will modify the seperate txt file)
About us: the job listings can be updated (system will modify the seperate txt file)
Election info: system will allow editing, creation and archival of notices, and allow selection of which to display,
if no notices are displayed the no election notice will be shown instead.
Contact us: the contact details can be updated (system will modify the seperate txt file)

In addition a login system will be implemented to prevent unauthorised access, this will be the page that appears
prior to the main system UI and would be the only way to access it (the UI would kick you back to this page without
a valid login token, or redirect you if you attempt to load it before the login page)
