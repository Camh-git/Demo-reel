    <h3>What is the electoral commision?</h3>
	The electoral commision is an independant body operating out of the UK Home office with a parliamentary sub-commision, we report directly both to parliament and HMG.
	We organise and oversee the administration of all elections to offical posts and public offices in the United Kingdom.
	We maintain the electoral register and political finance database, we monitor all campaigns to prevent overspending and other offences.<br>
	In addition we monitor polling stations and the counting process on election day.<br>
	Finally we investigate any complaints or tip-offs both before and after an election, arbitrate said matters and issue repremands as necessary.
	
	<h3>How do I find out more about elections that aren't on the tracker?</h3>
	The commision posts notices about upcoming elections on the election info section of our website, how far in advance these notices are posted depeneds on the election.
	Major national events, such as general elections or nation-wide referendums will be displayed several months in advance and pinned to the top of the page,
	Mayoral elections for major cities may be posted 2 months in advance, whilst towns or vilages may only have approprate notices posted a month beforehand.<br>
	Large groups of smaller elections, such as local council or regional pccs will also be posted, with directions to local authority sites for more information,
	We may post individual notices for abnormally timed elections.<br>
