   The following information reflects the policy position(s) of the office of Her majesty's electoral commision on the matters
   discussed below at the time of writting, for any updates, or for more information please feel free to contact the office
   using the information provided on the Contact us page.
   <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
   Be it herein enacted that the following shall be the policy of the office of her majesty's most honorabale and loyal electoral commision in relation to the aforementioned matter:<br><br> 
   (i)This website is hosted by Her majesty's government (herein reffered to as HMG) on behalf of The office of Her majesty's Most honorable 
   and loyal electoral commision (herein reffered to as the EC or the commision), this site is hosted out of the UK home office main building
   (12 exemplar road). This service is provided at no cost to the EC and the nature of the service is entirely at the EC's own discretion, as such
   any privacy, cookie, monitoring or other policy imposed on data traveling through the UK home office network does not apply, barring anti-virus and other
   network security tests required to protect the integrity of the network and get through home office firewalls. The EC wishes 
   to confirm that the contents of any packets or other information sent to this site, or any EC IT service are still private when they reach us, 
   and are used solely by the commission for their expected lawful purpose.<br><br>

   (ii)It is the current policy of the commision that it shall make no attempts to track or monitor users, beyond simple trafic metrics, or in any other
   way use common methods of extracting information from visitors that are widely considered to infringe on user privacy.
   As it currently stands the commision's website is a simple web presence with no vistior access or methods for users to input information into the site,
   as such it is the belief of the commision that any more serious monitoring of it's sites visitors is unnecessary at this time. Furthermore
   the commision belives that the use of more tracking than is necessary constitutes an unjustified infringement on visitor privacy.<br><br>
   
   (iii)For the sake of clarity, the following is a list of information that the commision currently collects from visitors to this site:<br>
     1.Each new visit increments daily and hourly visitor counters.<br>
     2.The time at which the user visited is logged to help identify busy hours and trafic spikes.<br><br>
   
   (iv)The commision recognises that as a branch of HMG it has considerable legal discretion and capability for tracking and harvesting user data.
   We intentionaly choose to limit our data collection as much as possible for two reasons:<br>
     1.As an organsiation set up to ensure fair play the EC belives it is only right to respect user privacy to the fullest extent possible.<br>
     2.Part of the EC's job is to recieve sensitive information from whistleblowers who may work for powerfull organsiations, as such we want to protect their anonymity<br><br>
  
   (v)By limiting it's collection and tracking activites at the current time the EC does not in any way waive its rights, legal powers or access to HMG provided capabilities for future
   use should it deem them necessary. Decisions to use such capabilities as are available to the EC in law are taken at the commision's sole discretion.<br><br> 
   
   (vi)Agreement with this policy is required for use of this website, by accessing and continuing to use this site you agree to the terms of the above policy.<br>
    If you do not wish to accept this policy this website may not be used by yourself or any individual or organisation acting on your behalf.<br><br>
	
    (vii)Agreement to the above policy can be withdrawn by writen request to the EC, in doing so you agree to section vi of this policy.<br>
 	This agreement expires after one week of continuous non-use of the subject site and can be renewed by recommencing use of said website.<br>
