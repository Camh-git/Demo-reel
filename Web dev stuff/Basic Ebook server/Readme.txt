This project is designed to be a simple browser based UI for accessing e-books
	stored in a folder on the server.
	
The primary functionality is the library, which automaticaly populates itself 
with the contents of the "books" folder.

The library will display each sub-folder and it's content and allow users 
to download the files for reading, or view supported file types
(Currently PDF, with EPUB on the To-do list)

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The next step for the project is to implement file manipulation on the web
UI via a management page, users can technicaly do this by accessing the 
books folder directly, but that goes against the spirit of the project.

THE PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, PLEASE SEE TODO.txt FOR MORE INFORMATION
