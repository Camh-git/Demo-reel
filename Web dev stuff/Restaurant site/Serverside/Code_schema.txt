Each segment may contain up to 1000 products, with an id consisting of it's prefix followed by it's indexed number, ranging from 0-999. 
  eg. the first item in Sides would be 2000 and the last would be 2999.

Each of these segments should be stored in a folder, named after their number and given name in the above schema.
  These folders should contain a tags file, highlighting tags that apply to the class as a whole, to make searching easier.

Any new segment(s) should be recorded in the schema above.


//The following is a remnent of the old shcema, kept for documentary purposes, please disregard
Should a segment overflow it's 100 item limit (e.g if mains reaches it's 101st entry) a new 100 item segment should be booked to store them, named (list being extended)_index+1
  eg. the 101st meal may become product 0500 in the range Mains_2
