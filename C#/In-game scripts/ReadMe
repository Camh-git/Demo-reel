A collection of miscellaneous scripts created using in-game programing api for the game space engineers.
This mostly exists to demonstrate working with this kind of API, some collision detection and sequencing.
The code for each project can be found in /project name/Program.cs

Note: some methods of opperation may be odd due to in-game restrictions, eg: waiting is handled by setting the
  block to re-run every X amount of milliseconds and counting the runs until a target is reached, this is done
  because the in-game system does not allow the use of thread.sleep or similar to prevent cheating.
