This script controls the actuation of a large, multi-segement door in the game space engineers.
The door is connected to the rest of the contruct via a single "merge" block and cannot make contact with any others (game restriction)
Due to a quirk of the game's physics the hinge that actuates the door must have pistons on both ends to make it a seperate grid object from the part's its connecting.
These complications, along with the inability to use any kind of thread.wait() style command give the script its current form.
The script follows a series of steps for each procces.
When the script has to wait for a step to complete it re-calls itself every 1.4 seconds and increments a timer until the timed action is complete, or, if completion is measured another way (eg if a piston has fully extended without reaching it's target) it has timed out.
