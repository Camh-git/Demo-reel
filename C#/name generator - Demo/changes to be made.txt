NOTE: this project originaly contained an additional name generator for mission names, this was removed from the demo version due to copyrighted content/ real life conflict references.
While the aforementioned generator has been removed, some references to it may still remain.

to do
move array content import to load
add polish such as message box details, ui alignment and general good practice/tidy up and consistency

done
Add delete button to history
add reload button on edit screen
add place name generator with option for number
added save source eddit function
added deselect button to edit page
sort lists alphabeticaly prior to saving
add edit source files form
add and implement banned items lists
have name component arrays import from list - was originaly local arrys, would not support saving changes
make view history form
add main menu
add save function as history list
add name generator with multiple options


completed touch ups
update edit page instructions
add using statements to the writers to handle disposal properly
remove the goto on fail and make the function run itself again
Load person source arrays from file
integrate sort button into page load - maked btn redundent, kept for layout purposes
have edit page textboxes auto empty when their addition or edit is made

canceled changes
improve expandability with dynamic edit page textboxes and suitable controls - not 100% but complicated and having an 
instrution document would be more sensible
prevent same answer being picked more than once, qol but more effort than it's worth and unlikely with a decently sized source list 
improve ui of edit page- looked slightly better but seriously compromised user friendlyness, unacceptable ux compromises.
