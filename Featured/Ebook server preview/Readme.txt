This is just a placeholder showing the three main pages of the site without any of the backend.

A books folder is provided to allow population of the libaray page, feel free to fill it with empty documents as you see fit
The library folder currently provides placeholder thumbnails for txt, pdf, epub, mobi, azw3 and html

This is a front end development demo, since not much else is available without the as of yet unfinished backend (check web dev stuff for the latest version)
