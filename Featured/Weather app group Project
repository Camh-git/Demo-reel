The final task of the tech returners program was a group project to setup a 
backend that calls at least 2 apis, manipulates the data and makes it
available on an endpoint.
The next part was to create a frontend using react that would call the API
and display the resulting data.

The 4 teammembers where myself, Timalka K, Marlon Tancredo and Zanna Prane
